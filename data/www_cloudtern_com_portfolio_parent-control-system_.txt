The Challenge
To oversee parents control the telecommunication services used by their children while enforcing restrictions on voice calls and SMS recipients while regulating data usage. Also to establish a calendar to dictate when children can access services like voice calls, SMS, and data.
The Solution
To ensure the digital well-being of children, the parental control system mandates adherence to predefined APIs for all interacting components, encompassing both front-end and back-end functionalities. Communication between these components occurs through a specified set of APIs. The system receives inputs from the core server via the MVNO Admin front-end for administrative tasks and from BSS/OSS using REST API. In the backend, a DRE system platform, OCS, manages operations. Offering various features, the software system empowers parents to oversee their dependents’ use of telecommunications services, including regulating access, contacts, and usage permissions for voice calls, SMS, and data services whenever accessible.
