The Challenge
Our client seeks a cohesive platform for convenient access to essential functionalities which includes location reachability, call quality, inbound call testing, firewall configuration, device registration, visibility, IP phones, reports, and networks.
The Solution
Utilizing the Laravel framework, we crafted a multi-tenant portal to optimize development, elevate user experience, and enhanced security. Laravel powers event notifications, while SIDEKICK drives cloud data integration. The API-centric LARAVEL-SIDEKICK duo seamlessly interfaces, supported by TimeseriesDatabase for continuous data acquisition, with high-chart and gauge meter visualizations for intuitive UI/UX. Laravel was employed to devise solutions for network problems and IP phone quality issues, including the creation of event notifications.
