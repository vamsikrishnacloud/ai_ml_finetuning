The Challenge
To support existing Run Time monitoring (RTM) functionalities, lengthy data sessions and intermittent timers which require continuous session state persistence due to their stateful nature. This persistence poses challenges for the telecom charging server application, particularly with multiple instances, as extended sessions unnecessarily tie up instances, causing resource bottlenecks and prolonged instance occupation. To address this, streamlining session persistence is imperative to alleviate resource constraints and ensure optimal server instance utilization.
The Solution
In the MVNE framework, RTM efficiently handles session data with Redis as a post-processing distributed data store, ensuring seamless message handling across the network. This decentralized approach optimizes resource usage and scalability for effective service to multiple instances.
To overcome RTM’s statefulness, a stateless prototype was created, using Redis for session state persistence. This frees instances promptly after message processing, facilitating swift handling of subsequent messages. Persisting session data in Redis decentralizes message processing, enabling any instance to manage initial updates and terminations. This optimized method boosts resource usage and enhances message handling efficiency in the MVNE framework.
Key Benefits
Enhanced Scalability
Utilizing Redis in the MVNE framework ensures superior scalability, optimizing resource allocation for seamless handling of increased message loads without compromising performance or reliability.
Improved Resource Utilization
The stateless prototype, paired with Redis for session state persistence, optimizes resource utilization by swiftly releasing instances after message processing. This maximizes throughput, minimizing resource wastage and ensuring optimal infrastructure utilization.
Streamlined Message Handling
Redis-based session data storage decentralizes message handling within the MVNE framework, reducing bottlenecks and latency associated with centralized processing. This enhances system responsiveness, ensuring timely service delivery to end-users.
Increased Efficiency and Performance
Decentralizing message processing with Redis enhances efficiency and performance, leading to faster response times and increased throughput. This strengthens the MVNE framework's competitive edge while enhancing user experience.
