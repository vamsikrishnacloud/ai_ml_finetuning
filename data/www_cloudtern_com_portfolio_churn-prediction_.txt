Our Role
Churn Prediction Solution
Company Overview
Leading UK based MVNO chose CloudTern for its customer retention strategies. CloudTern designed a Churn Prediction solution that identified possible churners to perfection while increasing customer satisfaction.
The Challenge
MVNO partnered with top Telcos in the UK and has invested in a high quality infrastructure to provide reliable telecom services to its customers.
While the company had no issues with the technical services, the main challenge was with churners. As MVNO offers subscription-based services, the increase in number of customers who cancel their subscription services was negatively affecting their revenues.
As the company serves thousands of customers, it is not easy to interact with each and every customer.
The company needed a reliable solution to identify possible churners so that they can go an extra mile to interact and retain those specific customers.
So, MVNO was looking for a technology partner to help them in churn prediction.
The Solution
MVNO chose CloudTern to develop a churn prediction solution to identify potential churners.
CloudTern designed a churn prediction service using the TensorFlow.
CloudTern implemented the neural network model to create the churn prediction service.
This model implements the learning algorithm for matching neurons using the created predictive ML model.
CloudTern Churn Prediction model is cloud-based software which means ABC Telecom employees can access this software from any location and device.
