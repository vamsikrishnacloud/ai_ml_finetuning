Mission
The cloud computing revolution is transforming the IT landscape. CloudTern stands at the forefront of this transformation. Our mission is to simplify IT management in the cloud. We offer a comprehensive cloud strategy that delivers end-to-end cloud solutions, right from designing the cloud migration plan and moving the infrastructure in small increments to managing the infrastructure on the cloud platform. CloudTern has already helped several organizations make a smooth transition to the cloud.
Vision
With the advent of cloud computing technology, the IT segment is innovating at a rapid pace. While large enterprises have the required budgets and expertise staff to quickly embrace this technological change, SMBs and small enterprises are struggling to keep up with this pace. CoudTern’s Vision is to remove these technological barriers and bridge this gap so that every business, regardless of its size and nature, can easily move the infrastructure to the cloud, refactor the existing infrastructure and fully leverage cloud solutions.
Inspiration
CloudTern takes its inspiration from Arctic Tern, an amazing bird that is famous for its long-distance migrations. Weighing only 100g, this tiny bird travels from Arctic breeding grounds to Antarctica and back again every year.
A recent study with tracking devices revealed that a Tern bird travels 1.5 million miles in its life time which are equivalent to three round trips to Moon.
Long-distances, convoluted routes and changing weather conditions don’t deter the mission of this bird.
This amazing migration journey inspired us to name our company as CloudTern.
