How the Cloud is Changing the Hospitality Industry?
cloud services for hospitality
Right from the first hotel reservation system “HotelType’ introduced in 1947 and the first automated electronic reservation system ‘Reservatron’ in 1958 to today’s AI-based platforms, hospitality technology has come a long way. While the industry was a bit late to adopt the cloud, it is quickly catching up with others in recent times.
The hospitality industry revenues are increasing at a rapid pace. According to
Global Hospitality Report
, the industry earned a revenue of $3,952.87 billion in 2021. This value is expected to reach $4,548.42 billion by the end of 2022, growing at a CAGR of 15.1% during the period 2021-2022. The smart hospitality market was valued at $10.81 billion in 2020. This value is expected to reach $65.18 billion by 2027, growing at a CAGR of 25.1% between 2021 and 2027, as reported by
Market Data Forecast
.
The hospitality industry is aggressively embracing cloud solutions in recent times. Here are a few reasons that are driving this adoption.
Mobility Solutions
‘Mobility solutions’ is a key aspect of cloud services. This is what the hospitality industry needs the most as its target audience comes from different parts of the globe. With a cloud-based hospitality platform, customers from any location and device can easily search for room availability, check out the available amenities and make convenient travel bookings from the comfort of their homes.
Unlimited Scalability of Operations On-demand
The hospitality industry is a special industry wherein traffic spikes are dynamic. During the off-season, the traffic is minimal while peak seasons bring a gold rush. For instance, Spring Flower Fest is conducted on the 31
st
of May every year at Callaway Gardens in Georgia. During this time, hotels and resorts receive a huge number of visitors. It is difficult for traditional software to handle this abnormal traffic spike. However, scalability is the key feature of cloud technology. Regardless of the size and nature of the traffic, hotel and resort management can seamlessly scale operations on-demand and only pay for the resource used.
Deliver Superior Customer Experience
Personalization is key to delivering a superior customer experience. The hospitality industry is no different. Today, customers are not just looking to spend a night in a hotel room but they expect something more. Cloud solutions augmented with AI analytics help organizations identify customer preferences, purchasing trends and browsing behaviours to offer personalized and customized offers. Be it about a special recipe, spa session or a visit to an amazing holiday spot and arranging the best travel option, customers will enjoy a convenient and exciting stay when they get much more than a hotel stay experience.
Seamless Integration across the Supply Chain
Traditional software doesn’t allow you to add new features that are not available with the vendor or integrate with other platforms. However, cloud solutions can be easily integrated with any platform across the supply chain. As such, organizations can quickly add/modify travel packages and seamlessly move between different vendors to offer customized offers to customers.
Automation everywhere
With automation incorporated across the business operations, hospitality institutions can concentrate on delivering a superior customer experience instead of worrying about property management.
Optimized Costs
In a traditional software environment, the hotel management has to invest heavily in the hotel management software licenses, and maintenance and then frequently update it. Cloud solutions come with a pay-per-use subscription model. It means you only pay for the resources used. There is no heavy upfront payment. During a peak season, the platform automatically scales up and down to meet traffic spikes. As such, operational costs are significantly optimized.
Simplified IT Management
While the technology improves the efficiency of hospitality operations, the industry doesn’t have the expert staff and required IT budgets to manage IT operations. Cloud solutions not only optimize costs but also simplify IT management. As the cloud provider handles the infrastructure management, software maintenance and updates, organizations are released from this burden. As such, they can deliver a superior customer experience while identifying ways to increase revenues.

How Managed services can boost your business in 2022?
Managed Network Services
The Covid-19 pandemic that forced a sudden lockdown across the globe expedited the digitalization of business operations and remote networks. This trend resulted in search for qualified IT professionals and the best technologies and services. While the dearth of qualified IT professionals posed a big challenge, dynamically changing technologies forced organizations to frequently update/change skillset and toolstack requirements. After going through the tedious hiring process that is burdened with insurance, labour laws and other perks, you don’t want to see a change in the technology that requires a different set of skills. This is where managed services come to the rescue.
Managed services is about outsourcing regular business operations to a 3
rd
party that has competence, skilled professionals and the right tool stack in a specific vertical. With access to a dedicated IT team 24/7, organizations can seamless perform business core operations without worrying about technical issues.
While every IT-related service can be outsourced, the most common managed services include managed software services, managed cloud services, managed network services etc.
Managed Cloud Infrastructure
Adapting cloud-native platforms is a key IT trend in 2022. Modern cloud-native architectures comprise container clusters deployed at rapid speeds. With dynamically changing infrastructure configurations, it is a challenge for administrators to keep a tab on change management. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a popular technology trend that is gaining momentum in 2022. Using IaC tools such as Terraform and CloudFormation, organisations can define infrastructure as code and thereby convert infrastructure into software. As such, software development best practices can be applied to infrastructure as well. With IaC and automation, organizations can seamlessly deploy and manage infrastructure resource provisioning. While all this looks good on paper, it requires expert knowledge to leverage this trend. MSPs possess these capabilities to keep you ahead of the competition.
Managed Network Services Leveraging 5G Technology
5G technology is becoming mainstream in 2022. The 5G technology enables organizations to virtualize software-defined networks and run them on commodity hardware. Each network function can be virtualized and packaged into a container As such, organizations can develop services as network functions and package them into containers. Container clusters are managed by container orchestration tools such as Kubernetes. Instead of investing heavily in infrastructure and IT professionals, organizations can outsource telecommunication services to an MSP to save costs while significantly improving operational efficiencies.
Leveraging IoT Networks
The rapidly evolving IoT technology boosted by the cloud, AI and 5G advancements provides a great opportunity for telecoms to create and manage IoT networks accommodating thousands of devices that communicate with higher speeds, lower latencies and are energy efficient. As telecoms possess the required infrastructure, they can easily leverage the 5G network capabilities. As 5G is still in the nascent stage and there are limited options in the form of customizing public IoT cloud or building an IoT platform from scratch, not many organizations have the required expertise and skillsets to optimize this technology. This is where MSPs can take over.
Managed Software Services
Software as a Service (SaaS) is a popular deployment model of cloud services where the software is hosted by the provider and delivered to the client over the Internet via a pay-per-use subscription model. Despite SaaS is an easy to use model, organizations use hundreds of tools and services that lack centralized management. Security and network configurations should be taken care of. Managed software services take this service to the next level by adding hardware and networking support. As such, organizations enjoy higher scalability, stability, predictability and security while optimizing cloud costs. For organizations that develop custom software, MSPs help you throughout the software application lifecycle.
The Bottom Line
Managed service providers bring a large plate of benefits to the table. Firstly, MSPs eliminate the need to install, configure and manage robust infrastructure containing a lot of moving parts. By placing the infrastructure responsibilities on the MSP, you can save huge costs as well as precious time. Secondly, MSPs offer the best tool stack that is always updated.

IoT for Telecommunications
The telecommunication sector is going through a tricky phase right now. The advent of the 5G technology augmented with the software-defined virtual networks is disrupting the industry on one side, opening a new landscape of opportunities. On the other side, there is tough competition from VoIP-based platforms such as Skype and Zoom. With an increased commoditization, telecoms are able to cut prices and stay in the competition. However, they had to take a hit on the Average Revenue per User (ARPU). Another important challenge is customer churn. With shrinking IT budgets and high competition, customer retention becomes a challenge for most telecoms. This is where IoT comes to the rescue.
How does IoT help Telecom Companies?
IoT technology is rapidly evolving. Telecoms can take full advantage of IoT networks as they already possess the infrastructure in the form of mobile phone towers and internet cables. When 5G is added to it, telecoms can build high-speed networks with low latency and accommodate a wide range of IoT devices wherein seamless connection is established between interconnected devices and people in the massive ecosystem. Telecoms can build IoT platforms that enable customers to connect and manage multiple endpoints and run IoT apps while managing the infrastructure from a central dashboard.
IoT with 5G offer high-speed networks with expanded bandwidths and low latencies to run real-time processes. Energy efficiency is a big advantage as companies can run millions of connected devices with minimal power consumption. With an IoT platform, telecoms can reduce churn while gaining new customers to increase revenues. Moreover, they can create new job opportunities and thereby contribute to the growth of the local economy as well.
IoT Use Cases for Telecom
While the basic functionality of IoT for telecoms is to provide connectivity services for the customer IoT devices, the use cases can be extended to industry-specific end-user apps as well.
IoT in home automation enables customers to control electronic devices at home using mobile apps or voice assistants.
Remote Asset Monitoring of physical assets such as orders, vehicles, patients etc. using a mobile application in real-time, benefitting healthcare, retail, logistics and several other industries.

Why CloudTern Chose Kubernetes for Container Orchestration?
In the traditional software development environment, creating an application was a simple process of writing the code. However, the rapid innovation that has brought-in a myriad of technologies, tools, frameworks, architecture and interfaces adds enormous complexity to application development environments. The advent of smartphones has opened up another world of mobile computing environment which adds up to this challenge. Developers now have to consider all these aspects while creating an application. Containerization solves all these challenges enabling developers to focus on just the application and not worry about runtime environment differences.
An Overview of Containerization
A container is a standalone and portable software unit that is packaged with code and its entire runtime environment such as binaries, libraries, dependencies, configuration files etc. By abstracting away the underlying infrastructure, OS and platform differences, containers facilitate seamless movement of applications between different computing environments. Right from a large enterprise application to a small microservice, containerization can be applied to any type of application or service. The absence of the OS image makes containers lightweight and highly portable.
The Evolution of Containerization
Containerization is not a new concept and has been around for decades. Unix OS Chroot was the first system that implemented containerization, providing disk space for each process. Derrick T. Woolworth extended this feature in 2000 wherein he added a sandboxing feature for file system isolation in FreeBSD OS. While Linux implemented this feature in its VServer in 2001, Solaris released containers for x86 in 2004. Similarly, Google introduced Process Containers in 2006 to isolate resources. Linux introduced container manager, LXC in 2008. CloudFoundry introduced LXC in Warden which was able to run on any operating system. Google introduced Linux app containers in 2013 which was called lmctfy. However, containerization gained widespread adoption with the advent of Docker in 2013.
Virtual Machines Vs Containers
Containers are often confused with virtual machines. Containers and virtual machines share a lot of similarities in terms of resource isolation and allocation but differ in the functionality. A virtual machine is created by abstracting physical resources from a machine and deployed to run in an isolated computing environment to deliver the functionality of a computing device. Each virtual machine contains the copy of the operating system and all the dependencies of the application running on it. A hypervisor is used to run multiple VMs on a single machine. As it contains the full copy of OS, it is larger in size and takes more time to boot.
While a VM virtualizes hardware resources, a container virtualizes the operating system. Multiple containers share the same OS kernel and run in isolation on the same machine. As there is no OS, containers are lightweight, portable, run more applications and take less time to boot. By combining both these technologies, organizations can gain more flexibility in managing and deploying a range of applications.
Benefits of Containerization
Containers bring amazing benefits to organisations. Here are a few of them:
Highly Portable
While the absence of a full OS copy in a container makes it light-weight, the abstraction of underlying infrastructure makes it highly portable. It means, containers can be easily deployed in an on-premise data center, public cloud or on any individual laptop. Containers run on Windows, MAC, Linux, virtual machines or even on bare metals, offering higher flexibility for development and deployment of applications.
Improved Efficacies and Increased Productivity
Containers clearly define the role of developers and operations teams. With language runtimes, software libraries and dependencies, containers assure predictable and consistent environments, regardless of where the applications run. As such, operations and development teams can stop worrying about software differences across environments and focus more on improving performance of apps, resulting in more productivity and efficacies.
Faster and Better Application deployment
Containerization significantly improves the build, test and deployment of applications. Compared to virtual machines that take minutes to load, containers can be spinned up within seconds. They share a single OS kernel, boot much faster and consume less memory. By packaging an app along with its dependencies into isolated software units, containers facilitate easy replication of apps on multiple machines across the clusters, rapid deployment and scaling.
Docker – A Synonym for a Container
Docker is an open-source tool that helps both development and operations teams in building, managing and deploying containers with ease. Docker was originally created for Linux but now supports MAC and Windows environments. Docker Engine is a runtime environment that lets you build and run containers and store these images in Docker Hub container registry.
As a leading cloud solutions company, CloudTern manages containerization needs for multiple companies. Docker offers the flexibility to integrate it with major infrastructure automation and configuration management solutions such as Puppet, Chef, Ansible, SaltStack etc. or independently manage software environments. In addition, Docker allows us to integrate it with the CI/CD pipeline and run multiple development environments that are similar to real-time production environments on a single machine or try different configurations, servers, and devices etc. for running test suites. As such, our clients were able to deploy software more frequently and recover faster while significantly reducing the change failure rate.
While there are other container management tools such as RKT, Canonical, Parallels etc., Docker is the most popular tool that has now become a synonym for a container. The fact that Docker can be used on any operating system or cloud makes it the first choice for many. At CloudTern, we proactively monitor technology changes and offer the best IT solutions for our clients. So, Docker is our first choice for all containerization needs.
Why Container Orchestration?
Looking at the significant benefits offered by containers, several organizations are now implementing container technology into their CI/CD environments. As containers are quick to spin up, lightweight and portable, thousands of containers are created and deployed across the infrastructure. A typical IT infrastructure runs hundreds of containers that come with a shorter lifespan which pose great complexity in infrastructure monitoring.  You need to closely monitor and manage them to know what’s running on each server. This is where cloud orchestration tools come to the rescue.
Kubernetes, Mesosphere and Docker are the most popular cloud orchestration tools.
An Overview of Kubernetes
Kubernetes is the most widely used container orchestration tool in recent times. Kubernetes was developed by Google and released in 2014. It is now managed by Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). Kubernetes allows organizations to easily automate deployment, scaling and management of container applications across a cluster of nodes. It is a standalone software that can independently manage containers without Docker or work with Docker in tandem.
A Quick Overview of Kubernetes Architecture
The kubernetes architecture consists of two core components:
Nodes
(bare metals or virtual machines): Nodes are again divided into two components:
Master
: A master node is where the Kubernetes is installed. The Master node controls and manages scheduling of pods across worker nodes where the application runs while maintaining the state of the cluster at its predefined state. Multiple master nodes are implemented to maintain high availability. Here are the key components of a master node.
Kube-contoller-manager
: It is responsible to maintain the desired state of a cluster by listening to the kube-apiserver about the information of the current state.
Kube-scheduler
: It is the service that schedules events and jobs across the cluster based on the availability of resources of predefined policies via the kube-apiserver.
Kube-apiserver
: It is the API server that enables UI dashboards and CLI tools to interact with Kubernetes clusters.
Etcd
: It is the master node storage stack that contains definitions, policies, state of the system.
Worker Node
: This is where the actual application runs. It contains the following components:
Docker
: It contains the Docker engine to manage containers.
Kubelet
: It receives instructions from the master node and executes them while sending information about the state of the node to the master.
Kube-proxy
: This service facilitates communication between microservices and pods within the cluster as well as connect the application to the outside world.
Pods
: A pod is a Kubernetes basic unit of deployment. All containers required to co-exist will run in a single pod.
Why CloudTern Chose Kubernetes?
As a leading cloud managed Services Company, CloudTern handles cloud networks of multiple organisations. A typical IT network comprises multiple nodes that can be anything from virtual machines to bare metals. Multiple nodes are implemented by IT administrators for two important reasons. Firstly, high availability is a key requirement for cloud-based services wherein the application should always be available to users even when a node is down. So, a robust infrastructure has to be set up. Secondly, scalability is a key concern. As the application traffic increases, more containers should be dynamically added or removed on-demand. Multiple containers of an application should talk to each other as well.
Docker Swarm is a container orchestration tool offered by Docker. It uses Docker API and works in tight integration with Docker. However, CloudTern chose Kubernetes because Kubernetes efficiently co-ordinates a large cluster of nodes and scales better in production compared to Docker that runs only on a single node. It helps you manage and orchestrate container resources from a central dashboard.
Kubernetes securely manages networking, load-balancing and scales well. In addition, it allows you to group containers based on a criteria such as staging environments or implement access permissions. So, it eliminates the need to mock up the entire microservices architecture of an application for the development team. You can deploy software across pods in a scale-out manner and scale in deployments on-demand. It gives clear visibility into the deployment process wherein you can check the completed, in-process and failed deployments from a single pane. You can save time by pausing and resuming a deployment at your convenience. The version control feature allows you to update pods with latest images of the application and roll back to a previous one, if needed.
With support for 5000 nodes and 300,000 containers, Kubernetes works well for organizations of all sizes. Combined with Docker, Kubernetes offers a highly scalable cloud orchestration system delivering fast and reliable applications. Kubernetes enjoys a large and vibrant community which means you can always be up to date with what’s happening with the tool or get help to resolve any issues.
The Bottom Line
Kubernetes is not just a personal choice. Today, Kubernetes is the market leader in container orchestration. According to
StackRox
, Kubernetes market adoption reached 86% by Spring 2019.  These market statistics once again affirm the fact that CloudTern always offers the right tools for the right IT tasks.

Digital BSS Overview
An Overview of Digital Business Support Systems (BSS)
Faster time to market is the main objective of digital transformation strategies of most organisations in recent times. With the digital innovation bringing agility and scalability into business processes, organisations are now able to quickly develop and deploy products. The communications industry is not excluded. While other industries are being able to quickly realign their business strategies to digitalize their offerings, the telecom industry faces several challenges on the roadmap to digital transformation. Legacy infrastructure, consolidation of back-end solutions that run on monolithic architecture and redundant systems, shrinking IT budgets are some of them. As customer demands are dynamically changing, businesses now need a dynamic solution that can digitalize their BSS.
The need for Digital BSS
Business support systems are the heart of any organization. In today’s fast-paced business world, having the best BSS is the key to successfully running any business. However, the rapid changing in technologies and customer behaviours have forced communication service providers (CSPs) to offer highly interactive and scalable BSS systems. With the Internet revolution that has been augmented with mobile and IoT, customer interaction modes have significantly changed. New interactive channels such as mobile apps, web and retail etc. and mode of communication such as emails, chats, social media and self-serving apps etc. are the need of the hour. Today, customers expect a quick, flexible and personalized interactive experience that is consistent and holistic across all channels. However, current BSS are bogged down with large monolithic architectures and traditional systems.
Adding to this challenge is the entrant of over-the-top (OTT) players and social networks such as Apple, Google and Facebook. As they offer video and voice calls, chats and other interactive channels that are easy, intuitive and fast, CSPs face a tough challenge in matching this agility. Secondly, there is a decline in voice revenues as data services are getting popular in recent times. To make up for this loss, CSPs are required to invest in new channels and upgrade existing networks while integrating them with existing BSS networks. The ever-increasing cloud solutions pose another challenge as they should be properly integrated into the existing infrastructure while streamlining the data warehousing infrastructure. A new digital BSS architecture is the answer.
Digital BSS Architecture
A digital BSS solution consolidates backend infrastructure, optimizes interoperability to offer a superior customer experience. At the heart of digital BSS sits the BSS API Framework. A Cassandra database can be used to facilitate faster data processing of thousands of requests per second. Complimented by the High Performance Data (HPD) Framework, the BSS API integrates all channels into a common information layer to deliver a unified communications system that is modular and highly scalable.
The BSS API Framework should support all types of APIs running on different domains. Whether you use a public API for externally processing applications or run a private API for communication between core components, Events API that update users with change in state or a data loading Import API, all APIs can seamlessly interact via the BSS API Framework.
A robust and comprehensive digital BSS should contain subsystems such as Product Order Management, Predictive Analytics, Revenue Management etc. for a comprehensive management of business processes.
Product and Order Management:
It defines customer profiles from technical and commercial perspective enabling you to flexibly offer differential pricing with higher customer satisfaction while eliminating the need to manage multiple catalogues across the organization.
Revenue Management:
For any business, revenue management is the key. A BSS revenue management subsystem offers a centralized billing system that allows you to manage billing, invoicing, collections etc. with business agility and centralized control, you can optimize costs and improve revenues.
Predictive Analytics:
Closely monitoring changing technologies and customer trends, Predictive Analytics analyses business data and offers data-driven decision making systems.
Predictive Analytics:
Closely monitoring changing technologies and customer trends, Predictive Analytics analyses business data and offers data-driven decision making systems.
Similarly, you can add other sub-systems such as Intelligence Channel system that offers predictive customer service, Customer Profiling, Credit Decision Tool, Reporting & Analytics tool, Office management etc. An intuitive dashboard is a key component that allows you to monitor and manage entire BSS operations from a centralized dashboard. When rightly implemented, digital BSS solutions bring a new level of intelligence to your business processes.
The State of Digital BSS Market
According to
MarketsandMarkets
, the global digital market was valued at $2.8 billion in 2018. This value is expected to touch $5.8 billion by 2023, growing at a CAGR of 15.2%. similarly,

Beacon technology for Asset Tracking
The advent of Internet of Things (IoT) has not only revolutionized IT networks but it also paved way for a range of new and innovative technologies. The beacon technology is one among them. Right from the time when Apple introduced the beacon technology in 2013 to till date, the technology has greatly evolved and is getting better every day. While the beacon technology was initially used by retail businesses, its functionality is now being extending to every field. Asset tracking with beacons is the new trend. Using the beacon technology, businesses are now able to implement cost-effective and highly scalable asset tracking solutions.
An Overview of Beacons
A beacon is a small Bluetooth-based device that is used to continuously transmit radio signals. This small form factor device contains a small radio transmitter and a battery. It uses the Bluetooth Low Energy(BLE) protocol to transmit data. As BLE consumes low energy, you can run beacons without draining out the battery. Depending on the size and functionality of the device, beacon batteries can last from 6 months to 5 years. However, it transmits low amounts of data which means you can’t transfer audio or streaming data.
The beacon technology is similar to Near-field Communication (NFC) technology. However, the difference lies in the range. While NFC functions within 8 inches, beacons can work within a range of 70 meters.
The State of Beacon Market
Beacons have become the first choice for many companies when it comes to Real-Time Location System (RTLS) solutions. According to Grandview Research, the global Bluetooth beacon market is expected to reach $58.7 billion by 2025, growing at a CAGR of 95.3% between 2017 and 2025. Similarly, Allied Market Research reports that the global beacon market would reach $14.839 billion by 2024, growing at a CAGR of 61.5% between 2018 and 2024. GM Insights reports that the market value of beacons was $170 million in 2016. This value is expected to grow at a CAGR of 80% between 2017 and 2024. The retail industry is the largest market for beacons followed by the health sector.
Source: https://www.statista.com/statistics/827293/world-beacons-technology-market-revenue-by-end-user/
Analyst firm Statista reports that the global beacon market was valued at $519.6 million in 2016. This value is expected to reach $56.6 billion by 2026, growing at a CAGR of 59.8% between 2016 and 2026.
The Technology behind Beacons
Beacons perform a single task. They just send a radio signal at pre-defined intervals. BLE-enabled devices such as smartphones receive these signals and act accordingly. Each beacon is assigned with a unique identifier. So, the device transmits this unique identifier which enables the receiver to identify the location of the beacon as well as the location of the user.
A beacon contains a small ARM (Advanced RISC machines) computer, Bluetooth connectivity module and a small battery. This small CPU runs the firmware written in low-level programming that controls the behaviour of the beacon. As the beacon’s job is to transmit its identifier, the small CPU power and battery is more than sufficient to process this data or encrypt the identifier. Inside the beacon you will find a small antenna that transmits electromagnetic waves. It uses the Bluetooth protocol. The latest Bluetooth standard is 4.2. The normal frequency of the beacon radio waves is 2.4 GHz and the maximum data limit for the 4.2 standard is 257 bytes. With such small amount of payload, beacons transmit the UUID, major, minor and the signal power. The receiving devices calculate the proximity of the beacon based on the transmitted signal power.
Beacon transmits the following components
Universally Unique Identifier (UUID): It is the unique identifier that differentiates your beacons from other devices outside your network.
Major Value: It is the unsigned integer value that tells you about the group in which the beacon is placed. For instance, beacons installed in the 1st floor will have the same major value. The value can be anything between 1 and 65535.
Minor Value: It is the unsigned integer that differentiates a beacon from a group. The value falls between 1 and 65535.
Here is an example of a UUID:
f626db6-3ga2-4e98-8013-bc5b71f0983c
When you talk about a beacon, you think about a physical device. However, some smartphones can act as a transmitter as well as a receiver. For instance, Apple doesn’t offer any physical beacon. It has incorporated the beacon technology into iOS 7 operating system. With more than 200 million iOS 7 devices in the market, Apple already has a considerable amount of beacons in the market.
How are beacons useful?
Beacons don’t relay any important message. They simply relay their IDs. It is the job of the receiver device to apply this information into a useful solution. For instance, a retail mall installs beacons inside the mall. When a customer visits the store and browses the electronic section of the mall, the beacon installed at that place will transmit its ID. The app in the smartphone of the customer will receive the ID and identifies the location of the customer. In this case, the app identifies that the customer is at the electronics section. So, the app will send discounts and offers related to the electronic products of that mall. Moreover, these offers would be specific and customized for that customer.
Asset tracking with Beacons
Asset tracking and management is a key requirement for any industry. Beacons can significantly reduce the cost and complexity of this job. There are multiple ways to track assets using beacons. For instance, you can mount BLE receivers in a permanent fixture and tag assets to beacons. When an asset comes into proximity of a BLE-enabled receiver, it tracks the movement via mobile data or Wi-Fi and logs the data. You can either take action or store the information for management and analytics purposes. Using beacons, you can cost-effectively track thousands of assets in real-time, 24/7.
There are instances wherein you cannot mount BLE receivers in permanent fixtures in temporary locations such as conference halls or function halls. In such cases, you can fix beacons in different places and track assets using a mobile app. By tagging assets to beacons, you can track each asset from the mobile app. Implementation is easy as there is no need for wiring or costly installation.
For more accuracy and maximum coverage, you can augment the beacon setup with additional receivers. You can install fixed beacons and fixed BLE receivers and augment them with moving beacons and moving BLE receivers. This setup can be extremely useful in low-signal areas such as ICUs of a hospital or a high-security airport check points. In areas such as large construction sites, environments quickly change. As such, you need a dynamic beacon architecture. In such cases, you can complement beacons with GPS and Wi-Fi. Depending on your environment, business type and requirement, you can choose the right deployment beacon technology.
Asset tracking with beacons is quickly gaining traction. Reports show that beacons have significantly reduced operational costs of asset management tasks. According to a Proximity Directory report, a total of 15,176,500 proximity sensors were installed globally in Q2, 2017.

IoT with Private LTE Networks is disrupting the Industrial Vertical – Is your business ready for this innovation?
In Feb 2017, Qualcomm along with GE and Nokia announced a successful demonstration of private LTE for industrial IoT market which created a great buzz in the industrial IT circles. This team has conducted live field trails to continue the research based on this demonstration throughout 2017 by integrating their platforms and technologies. While Nokia provided the base infrastructure and the Nokia Digital Automation Cloud Service for a private network, Qualcomm offered the wireless connectivity with chipset devices and GE integrated these solutions onto its Industrial IoT platform Predix for a better control of industrial resources across the infrastructure. GE leverages the Predix platform with a private LTE network setup at GE headquarters. This demonstration brings private LTE networks into the limelight.
An Overview of LTE Networks
Long Term Evolution (LTE) is an innovative high-speed wireless network technology that comes with low latency and high speeds over long distances for data terminals and mobile devices via UMTS technologies. It was designed by 3
rd
Generation Partnership Program (3GPP) as a 4G network communications standard to offer higher speeds for wireless networks; ten times faster than 3G networks. With IP-based voice, data and multimedia streams, LTE networks offer speeds between 10 Mbit per second and 1 Gbit per second and is easy to deploy and use. They can be deployed on different frequency bandwidth blocks. The current LTE networks support 1.4MHz, 3MHz, 5MHz, 10 MHz, 15MHz, and 20MHz. every 5MHz spectrum of each cell support around 200 active connections.
How does it work?
LTE uses two different air interfaces for downlink and uplink purposes. For the downlink from the tower to the device, LTE uses Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) air interface which allows multiple connections on a single cell and increased throughput of a connection. Similarly, for the uplink from the device to the tower, LTE uses Discrete Fourier Transform Spread Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (DFTS – OFDMA) air interface. With varying air interfaces for downlink and uplink, LTE networks optimize connections with better battery life for the devices.
LTE for Industrial IoT
LTE technology is not new but it gained momentum with the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT). While the cloud computing revolutionized the IT world and centralized resources, it paved a way for BYOD networks wherein mobile devices entered the network. The next big step was Internet of Things wherein sensors and other industrial devices joined the IT networks. With IoT, organizations are able to facilitate communication between a range of devices including IT and non-IT devices.
The main challenge for Industrial IoT is connectivity issues. More often, industrial companies have their temporary facilities located in remote places wherein reliable network connection is not easy to obtain. Whether it is an oil excavation site, mining site or a power plant, the regular network might provide basic connectivity but not the required speed and efficacy. As industrial infrastructure is now equipped with robotics, automated guided vehicle (AGV), drones, Augmented reality and virtual reality (AR/VR), high-speed and low latency data transfer becomes a critical requirement. The data should be stored locally while having a global access. Services should be interoperable. This is where LTE networks come to the rescue. The temporary industrial sites can set up a standalone LTE network and enjoy reliable and faster network connectivity for that facility.
The state of LTE Networks
Today, every cellular mobile device supports 4G LTE network. While AT&T and Verizon launched 4G LTE networks, others are quickly following them. According to
ReportsandReports
, the global investments in LTE networks accounted for $800 million in 2016. This value is expected to grow at a CAGR of 32% between 2016 and 2020.
Persistence Market Research
envisages that the global LTE networks market value would reach $926.1 billion by 2024, growing at a CAGR of 13.1% between 2016 and 2024. Similarly,
Harbor Research
reports that the private LTE network would reach $17 billion by 2022.
Public LTE Vs Private LTE
Enterprises can either choose public or private LTE networks. When it comes to a public LTE offering, the network is managed by the service provider. While it gives wide-area coverage, it is also shared by other customers. Public LTE networks provide general voice and data services.
Private LTE networks bring additional benefits to the table. Firstly, private LTE networks come with dedicated equipment and are managed locally, giving better control over data. Moreover, there are no sudden traffic surges. With the consistent performance, industrial facilities can manage productivity at predictable levels. Secondly, private LTE networks are easy to deploy and use for dedicated as well as virtual resource-based infrastructure. Thirdly, private LTE networks offer dedicated service which means high-quality service is guaranteed along with the ability to customize the network to suit industrial-specific needs.
Benefits of Private LTE Networks
Support multiple devices with higher bandwidth
Customizable for features such as mobile settings and quality of service
Highly secure
Better control over data
Future proof as you can leverage the LTE roadmap
Superior coverage for indoors and outdoors
Seamless mobility
Interoperability between suppliers
Private LTE Networks take the Industrial IoT to a new horizon
As the IoT networks increased, the need for higher speed and coverage, full mobility, latency and quality of service became a critical requirement for industrial facilities such as airports, ports, container ports, warehouses etc. Qualcomm has partnered with GE and Nokia to create a unified communication network system. The result is the first Private LTE-based network for industrial IoT. By integrating all the devices in the network and bringing them onto an industrial OS Predix platform, organizations are now able to incorporate latest technologies such as machine learning, analytics, artificial intelligence and predictive maintenance to significantly improve the efficiency of business processes and services. Nokia takes the automation to a new level by offering a private plug n play LTE ecosystem. The wireless communication is managed by Qualcomm. Multefire is an LTE deployment initiated by Qualcomm and Nokia. It is now managed by Multefire Alliance that was formed in December 2015. Similarly, Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in the US has defined Citizen Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) that offers 150 MHz shared spectrum band in 5.5 GHz band. So, organizations have two solutions to cost-effectively own and manage their private LTE networks without purchasing spectrum licenses.
As private LTE networks bring low latency and high-speed wireless connectivity, industries can add more sensors, analytics and automation devices to efficiently manage business-critical procedures such as handheld computing, AGV, head mounted display, industrial robots, edge computing and analytics, interactive maintenance, environmental sensors, drone inspection, turbine and blade sensors etc..
Private LTE Use cases
Manufacturing Vertical
In manufacturing industries, welding robots are commonly used for welding and handling automobile parts on the assembly line. Synchronization between a robot and the assembly line sensor is critical for precision of a process. A small delay in communication will result in the collision between the robots that in turn collapses the entire assembly line processes. For this reason, many industries are running hard-wired connections that are expensive. Moreover, wired connections occupy more footprint and clog the area as well. With private LTE networks, organizations can operate with wireless robots and thereby save time, money and footprint.
Mining Vertical
In a mining location, people have to work in harsh and remote environments. While sophisticated and automated solutions are available, organizations cannot use them owing to the lack of proper communication systems for real-time data for remote vehicles, systems, and the monitoring center. With a private LTE network, organizations can replace regular vehicles with driverless vehicles so that they can quickly reach out to remote areas and precisely apply drill blast procedures. The mining operations can be efficiently monitored from a centralized dashboard.
Healthcare Vertical
Healthcare is one of the important verticals that hosts a large number of IoT devices ranging from scanners and X-Rays to clinical and biometric devices. However, healthcare organizations use Wi-Fi only because they are not able to choose one mobile service provider’s ratio for all devices. Obtaining FDA certification for all clinical devices is cumbersome. However, the CBRS LTE networks now allow organizations to choose a spectrum that is independent of a mobile service provider. Moreover, one FDA certification would work for any private LTE spectrum.

How to import VM image to AWS
One of the coolest features I like about AWS is it not only gives you the powerful images through AMI but also allows you to import your VM images running in your data center as well. In this, I would like to show you how simple it is to import the VM image into the AWS
The prerequisites for VM import are
Configure the AWS CLI on the VM.A simple How-To guide can be found here in this link
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html
S3 Bucket in the region you want to import the VM
IAM Role named VMimport
For S3 Bucket I am assuming name “my-vm-imports”
Creating IAM Role
You cannot create using the AWS management console. You have to follow the aws- only
create a trust policy trust-policy.json

Getting started with Internet of Things (IoT)
Introduction
Internet of Things (IoT) has been the latest buzz in IT circles in recent times. This disruptive technology is bringing digital, analog and mechanical devices under a single umbrella to simplify infrastructure management. IoT secures business processes, improves operational efficiencies, optimizes costs and allows for better decision making.
According to
MarketsandMarkets
, the market value of IoT reached $157.57 billion in 2017. This value is expected to touch $561.04 billion by 2022, growing at a CAGR of 26.9%.
Junip
er
envisages that the total number of devices connected to the IoT networks would reach 42 billion by 2021. According to a
McKinsey
report, the IoT market that was valued at $900 million in 2015 is expected to touch $3.7 billion in 2020, growing at a CAGR of 32.6%.
An overview of Internet of Things
Internet of Things is a system or network of interconnected things, ranging from digital devices to mechanical devices and sensors, with an ability to transfer or exchange data without human or computer intervention. The transfer of data is done using unique identifiers. Simply put, IoT is a network of things. These things can be anything from an animal with a biochip, a human with a monitoring chip implant or a built-in sensor that monitors the temperature of a device.
In the tradition network setup, only computer devices were able to communicate with each other. With the advent of the IoT, computers, sensors and other mechanical devices are able to join any network and exchange data between them. Internet of Things is actually a combination of Microservices, wireless technologies and micro-electrical mechanical systems (MEMS). It was first mentioned by Kevin Ashton of MIT Auto-ID center in 1999. The advent of IoT has allowed people to analyze machine-generated data and better control business procedures.
How do IoT Systems work?
The IoT system comprises multiple devices or sensors, each assigned with a unique identifier. For instance, a logistics company runs a fleet of vehicles with a GPS system, a power plant uses a sensor to monitor the temperature of a boiler, a biochip implanted to an animal to check its temperature etc. The data collected from a device/sensor is automatically uploaded to the cloud or to a central location using a variety of communication protocols such as LAN, WAN, Wireless, cellular network, low-energy Bluetooth, NFC, RFID, ZigBee, Z-Wave etc.
The data that is stored in the cloud is processed using an analytics software. Based on the threshold values set by the user, the software monitors the data and automatically performs specified actions. For instance, if the boiler temperature is set to a threshold value and if it reaches that value, the software automatically turns off the boiler to avoid blasting. At the same time, it sends an alert notification to the concerned people. Using a centralized dashboard, you can remotely monitor and manage the IoT infrastructure with ease.
How do devices in an IoT network speak to each other?
When you send data from one device to another, the data is broken into smaller packets that travel through various routes to reach the destination. Once the data reaches the destination, the pieces of data are reassembled. An Internet Protocol is used for this messaging system. There are two types of internet protocols; Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP). While UDP is quick and efficient, it doesn’t verify the receipt of the data. TCP actually checks if the data has arrived.
When it comes to the Internet of Things, there are multiple devices that vary in hardware, software, connectivity, application and messaging protocols. So, communication methods differ with each IoT system.
Common Communication Protocols for IoT systems
IoT Device to IoT Device
When you want an IoT device to communicate with another IoT device, Data Distribution Service (DDS) is a good option. It is a middleware protocol that uses the publish-subscribe model to receive and send data. DDS protocol eliminates complex network programming in distributed applications and offers highly scalable and reliable data connectivity. With message-centric middleware, developers have to write code for sending messages. However, data-centric middleware is aware of the data it stores. DDS is data-centric which
means it is best suited IoT networks, offering better control over data management. With a rich set of Quality of Service (QoS), DDS enables you to control how data is stored and distributed which makes it a better choice for industrial IoT as well as consumer IoT.
IoT Device to the Cloud
When you want to collect data from multiple IoT devices in a large network and send this data to the cloud for analysis, you need a system that can efficiently ingest massive amounts of data. For instance, a large shopping mall contains multiple HVAC devices. Each HVAC device reports metrics such as temperature, humidity, load, energy consumption, air quality and desired temperature etc., generating gigabytes of data in few seconds. To process, store, analyze and manage these massive datasets, you need a powerful messaging system. Apache Kafka is the answer.
Apache Kafka
Sensor devices cannot run the full stack of TCP protocols. So, they use an IoT gateway such as Zigbee or Z-Wave to aggregate datasets and route them to the corresponding data points. Apache Kafka clusters receive these datasets and send them to corresponding data points, for instance, metrics such as temperate and humidity needs real-time monitoring. So, they are sent to real-time processing solutions such as Apache Spark or Apache Storm. Similarly, metrics such as energy consumption and load are collected over time and analyzed using Hadoop data analytics systems. Apache Kafka acts as a publish-subscribe messaging system wherein massive amounts of datasets are ingested into the system.
MQTT
When you use multiple client apps that exchange real-time messages on various topics, Message Query Telemetry Transport (MQTT) is a good choice. Invented by Dr. Andy Stanford of IBM, MQTT is a lightweight protocol that uses the publish-subscribe messaging system. Working on top of the TCP/IP protocol, MQTT facilitates data communication even in low bandwidth networks. It uses the TCP/IP port 1883. Being a lightweight protocol, it allows devices with small code footprint to remotely send data to the cloud. MQTT is best suited for mobile devices wherein low power usage, small footprint and minimized data packets are involved.
CoAP
When you have resource-constrained devices such as wireless sensors nodes in the IoT network, Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a good choice. This service-layer protocol enables constrained nodes to easily communicate with the regular nodes on the Internet. It can be easily integrated with the web as it easily translates to HTTP. CoAP is also used for sending SMS by communication networks.
RESTful API
As multiple devices are connected to an IoT network, developers should be able to access specific devices without knowing their protocols or intricacies. REST APIs enable you to expose them as interfaces so that you can write code for devices as you normally do for backend systems. RESTful APIs are best suited for IoT systems as they allow any device that can use HTTP to make its state available and standardize a way to manage data. So, developers can write a code wherein you check the state of a light bulb and turn it on/off. REST uses a unified architectural style which means a single app can use the same software written in different programming languages. With RESTful APIs, developers can focus on the application interactions instead on the applications themselves.
A common IoT platform is the need of the hour
As there are multiple devices involved in IoT networks, it is not easy to come up with a common protocol for device communication. There are two groups that are trying to create a common communication platform for IoT devices. The first one is Allseen Alliance that is backed by companies such as Qualcomm and Cisco. The second one is Open Interconnect Consortium that is backed by companies such as Intel and Samsung Electronics. Allseen Alliance released a software framework platform called the Alljoyn IoT platform recently. OIC came up with another framework platform called IoTivity. Looking at these efforts to implement standards in the IoT network, we can expect complete operability within the IoT in the days to come.

Hybrid Cloud Architecture with CISCO CSR 1000v
Cisco CSR 1000v series is a router software appliance from Cisco. It provides enterprise routing, VPN, Firewall, IP SLA, and more.CSR 1000v can be used to connect multiple VPC across all-region in AWS Cloud and on-premise networks. Thus it can be used avoid managed VPN service from AWS.
In AWS, you can find Cisco CSR 1000v in AWS marketplace which has 30 days free trial to test it out.
AWS Marketplace for Cisco
. Be aware this is not cheap, it will cost you EC2 Instance charges. All instance types are not supported for CSR 1000v. It supports only m3 and c3 instance family types.
Cisco CSR 1000v Can be used in various network models in cloud like Transit VPC, multi-cloud Network.
Following is the Architecture I have used to connect multiple VPC.
The two VPC’s are one in N.Virginia region and other is in Ohio Region. And Each VPC has Internet Gateway and were connected over VPN. On Ohio region, we used AWS managed VPN service to connect VPC in N.Virginia region VPC. And On-Premise Edge Router we used Cisco RV110W small business router. In this Post, I would like to mention the steps to follow to establish VPN over two VPC’s spread in two different regions in AWS.
Steps to create VPC’s in two regions:
Create VPC in N.Virginia Region with CIDR 10.0.0.0/16 and attach Internet Gateway to it. you can do it from CLI or through the management console.
aws ec2
create
-vpc
--cidr-block 10.0.0.0/16 --region us-east-1

              }
          }



aws ec2 attach-internet-gateway
--gateway-id <<IGW-ID>> --vpc-id <<VPC-ID>> --region us-east-1
Create two subnets in N.Virginia Region VPC, one for CSR 1000v with CIDR 10.0.0.0/24 and another subnet with CIDR 10.0.1.0/24.
aws ec2
create
-subnet
--cidr-block 10.0.0.0/24 --vpc-id <<VPC-ID>> --region us-east-1

          }
Create Route Table in N.Virginia VPC which will have the default route to Internet Gateway.And associate CSR subnet to it.
4. Launch the CSR 1000v from AWS MarketPlace with the one-click launch.
Link To AWS Marketplace
, you can ssh into the CSR 1000v instance using
ec2-user
.Attach Elastic IP to the CSR instance which will act as Customer Gateway in N.Virginia Region VPC. In later steps, we will configure the router to add Static routes to other subnets in VPC and setting BGP to propagate routes over VPN Connection with other VPC.
5. In a similar fashion create VPC in AWS Ohio region with CIDR 10.1.0.0/16 And create two subnets with CIDR 10.1.0.0/24 and 10.1.1.0/24
Steps to Create VPN connection in AWS Ohio VPC
Create Customer Gateway. Open VPC management console at
console.aws.amazon.com
. In navigation pane choose Customer Gateway and then create new Customer Gateway. Enter Name, Routing type as Dynamic and EIP of the CSR 1000v instance in N.Viriginia Region VPC. ASN number is 16-bit and must be in the range of 64512 to 65534.
Create VPG and attach to the VPC.In the Navigation Pane choose Virtual Private Gateway and create VPG.
Now Create VPN connection. In Navigation Pane Choose VPN Connection, Create New VPN Connection. Enter the Name, VPG and Customer Gateway which we have created previously, select routing type as Dynamic and create VPN connection.
It will take few minutes to create VPN connection. When it is ready to download the configuration for Cisco CSR from the drop-down menu.
Steps to establish VPN Connection on CSR 1000v
Add static routes of other subnets in VPC(N.Virginia) to CSR 1000v. Every subnet in AWS has a virtual router with IP address of Subnet CIDR +1. As CSR router will be in Subnet 10.0.0.0/24  the virtual router IP address will be 10.0.0.1. The Virtual Router on each subnet has a route to other all subnets in the VPC.
>Configure terminal
#ip route 10.0.1.0 255.255.255.0 10.0.0.1
Configure BGP. Choose the ASN number which you gave while creating Customer Gateway in Ohio VPC. Above we gave 64512
> Configure terminal
(config)
#router bgp 64512
(Config-router)
# timers bgp keepalive holdtime
(Config-router)
# bgp log-neighbor-changes
(Config-router)
# end
This step might not be necessary. But as good practice, I have applied the above configuration before copying the configuration file that is downloaded before.
Apply the Configurations that are downloaded previously when VPN Connections Created. After you have applied those setting on CSR you can see on the management console that both the tunnels of VPN as UP.
Testing to check connectivity between two VPC’s
Launch an instance in subnet1 in Ohio region VPC’s with Public IPv4. SSH into the instance and ping the CSR 1000v instance private IP.
Similarly, you can check connectivity with Ohio Region VPC by pinging the instance in subnet1 in Ohio region VPC with its Private IP.
Troubleshooting
:
> Route Propagation must be added to the route table in Ohio Region VPC.
> You must configure CSR 1000v as NAT, so the subnets in N.Virginia region can access the hosts in Ohio region VPC via CSR 1000v. You need to Update the route table with target fo CSR 1000v instance-id after making it as NAT.
> Allow ICMP in Security groups on all instances.
