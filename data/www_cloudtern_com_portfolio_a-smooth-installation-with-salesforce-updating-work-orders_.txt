The Challenge
Coordinating between Altice and XChange (SkyWire Networks) presents a logistical challenge. For seamless communication system installation at the client’s location, Altice must first set up its device, followed by XChange installing theirs. However, the real challenge lies in synchronizing the schedules of both companies’ technicians to ensure smooth, timely, and successful deployment. Effective collaboration and precise timing are crucial to avoid delays and ensure the client’s system is running.
The Solution
CloudTern plays a pivotal role in XChange’s service appointment scheduling process. When a new customer is onboarded through Salesforce, XChange automatically creates a work order and schedules a Service Appointment, specifying the necessary date and time. This scheduled information is then communicated to Altice for reconciliation.
Altice responds with a daily report, outlining the availability of their agents for each customer, which may or may not align with the originally scheduled appointment by XChange. CloudTern takes charge of a critical task within the work order: Auto_Update_Ext_Sched. This task is responsible for monitoring and updating the scheduling of Altice agents within Salesforce.
Upon receiving Altice’s daily report, CloudTern’s service automatically updates the task with the proposed schedule from Altice and compares it with the XChange-scheduled Service Appointment. Based on this comparison, two scenarios are possible:
Matching Schedules: If the dates and times match, the task is confirmed, and we ensure both agents arrive at the client’s location simultaneously.
Conflicting Schedules: If there’s a discrepancy, we reschedule the task, requiring further review with Altice to agree on a new, mutually convenient time.
Depending on whether the task is confirmed or rescheduled, and subsequent workflows are triggered, we ensure seamless coordination and service delivery.
Key Benefits
Coordination and Efficiency
By automating the reconciliation of schedules between XChange and Altice, the process ensures that both parties are aligned, minimizing miscommunication and delays. This streamlined coordination improves overall operational efficiency.
Improved Customer Satisfaction
Ensuring service appointments are accurately scheduled and confirmed reduces the likelihood of missed or delayed appointments, leading to a more reliable and satisfactory customer experience.
Conflict Resolution
The system's ability to automatically detect and reschedule conflicting appointments allows for proactive resolution, avoiding potential disruptions and ensuring that service delivery remains on track.
Automated Workflow Triggers
Integrating computerized workflows following the confirmation or rescheduling of tasks ensures that subsequent actions are initiated without delay, maintaining momentum and reducing the need for manual intervention.
